Persian language could be considered a major langauge in the family of Indo-Eaurpean languages where its native speakers and people who speak Persian as a second lanaguge add up to about 110M people worldwide. Despite the vast population of Persian speakers there are not many resources for processing Persian documents in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With this incentive we at [Miras](https://miras-tech.com) decided to start a project, aiming at provinding an NLP web service with real world applicatons.
