Persian language could be considered a major language in the family of Indo-European languages where its native speakers and people who speak Persian as a second language add up to about 110M people worldwide. Despite the vast population of Persian speakers there are not many resources for processing Persian documents in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). With this incentive we at [Miras](https://miras-tech.com) decided to start a project, aiming at providing an NLP web service with real world applications.
