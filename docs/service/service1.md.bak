Using machine learning and one of its thriving domain (i.e. deep learning) we built a system to analyze sentiments associated with various texts in order to get actionable insights where texts bear subjective tonality such as comments and reviews.
 
Zaal provides two types of sentiment analysis methods, **Document Level** and **Aspect Based**.
In the former comments and reviews are classfied into `negative`, `neutral` and `poistive` in a hollistic approach but in the latter, a comment or review is broken into meaningful parts that each part could have its specific tonality about something (i.e. an aspect).
